# Q-learning

The following project has been made as a project task for the course "Object-oriented programming with C++" at Aalto University.

In simple terms the project consists of bots that try to teach themselves how to move in an unknown world.

Please have a look at our documentation under `doc/` for more information, or jump straight to the implementation under `src/`.

*The project utilizes CMake, so it should be multi-platform. However, it has only been extensively tested on computers running Ubuntu. *
