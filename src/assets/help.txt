Camera:
    Right       focus off master worm and move right
    Left        focus off master worm and move left
    +           zoom closer to worm
    -           zoom farther from worm
    Space       focus back to master worm and reset all changes

Physics:
    A           increase physics simulation speed
    S           decrease physics simulation speed
    Q           jump 1000 iterations into the "future"
    Z           increase the maximum motor torque of the master worm by 1000
    X           decrease the maximum motor torque of the master worm by 1000
    C           increase the motor speed of the master worm by 0.1
    V           decrease the motor speed of the master worm by 0.1

General:
    M           change master worm to next in line
    N           change master worm to previous in line
    R           toggle the randomness of current master worm (this is indicated with "(R)"
                by the name if the worm is acting randomly, "(O)" when being optimal)
    P           toggle world iterations

    H           print this help message to the terminal
